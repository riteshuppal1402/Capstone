# TrafficPredCapstone
We worked in a four-person team for the Capstone Project on Long-Term Traffic Prediction, which uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. We have used one month of the PEMS dataset for this project for training purposes. We looked at numerous methods to capture traffic's spatial and temporal dependencies during the first half of the project. We then explored several ML-DL-based algorithms later in the project and ended up with Multi-channel CNN, which gave an average R2 score of 0.82 over a week prediction.
